        Focused development of the sixth edition started in 2009, as the fifth edition was being prepared for publication. However,
        this was preceded by significant experimentation and language enhancement design efforts dating to the publication
        of the third edition in 1999. In a very real sense, the completion of the sixth edition is the culmination of a fifteen
        year effort. The goals for this addition included providing better support for large applications, library creation,
        and for use of ECMAScript as a compilation target for other languages. Some of its major enhancements included modules,
        class declarations, lexical block scoping, iterators and generators, promises for asynchronous programming, destructuring
        patterns, and proper tail calls. The ECMAScript library of built-ins was expanded to support additional data abstractions
        including maps, sets, and arrays of binary numeric values as well as additional support for Unicode supplemental
        characters in strings and a regular expressi, oinis. The built-ins were also made extensible via subclassing. The sixth
        edition provides the foundation for regular, incremental
        <span class="w-highlight">language</span> and library enhancements. The sixth edition was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015.
